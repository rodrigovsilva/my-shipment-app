# MyShipmentApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.0.

## Install App
Run `npm install` to install all dependencies of this app.

## Starting App
Run `npm run start` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. I will use the application like production mode.


### For Developers 
## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Mock Server

Run `json-server -p 3001 ./server/data/shipments.json` to mock some database with json-server, but if you use `npm run start` you don't need to run this server standalone.
